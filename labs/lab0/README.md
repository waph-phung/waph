# WAPH-Web Application Programming and Hacking

## Instructor: Dr. Phu Phung

# Lab 0 - Development Environment Setup 

## Overview 

This lab is covered in Lecture 2, with preparation homework in Lecture 1. In Part I, you need to setup an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on VirtualBox and install software and applications. In Part II, you will clone the course repository and your private repository and complete git exercises to write the report.


## Report 

You need to create a sub-folder `labs/lab0` with a README.md file to write the report in Markdown format and generate the report to PDF using the `pandoc` application. Your report should follow the template provided in Lecture 2 ([https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md)) which should include the course name and instructor, your name and email together with your headshot (150x150 pixels), and then the following sub-sections:

## The lab's overview

Write an overview of the lab.

Also, include a direct clickable link to the lab folder on GitHub.com so that it can be viewed when grading, for example,  [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/labs/lab0](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/labs/lab0).


## Part I - Ubuntu Virtual Machine & Software Installation

A summary of steps you have performed to setup the Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine and install the required software and applications.

No screenshot is required in this sub-section; however, it is welcome, and detailed information is encouraged.

### Apache Web Server Testing

Include a **screenshot** to demonstrate that the Apache Web Server is running properly as it can be accessed in Google Chrome within your Ubuntu VM , and a browser in your laptop/computer using its IP address.


## Part II - git Repositories and Exercises

### The course repository

Include a **screenshot** to show that you have cloned the course repository into the home directory in your VM.

### Private Repository

Describe critical steps to create your private repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and share it with `phung-waph`. Also, include this repository's full URL, e.g., [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph.git](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph.git).

Summarize hands-on exercises, such as generating SSH keys, adding the public key to your GitHub account, cloning your remote repository into your VM, and editing the README.md following the provided template with my headshot.

Include a **screenshot** to illustrate that you committed the changes from your VM to your remote repository.

## Submission

Use the `pandoc` tool to generate the PDF report for submission from the `README.md` file, and ensure the report and contents are rendered properly.

The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-lab0.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-lab0.pdf`
